# Building Neural Networks from Scratch

As a Machine Learning Engineer and Data Scientist, creating complex neural networks with different architectures is a crucial skill. However, I believe that a deep understanding of how neural networks work behind the scenes is just as important. That’s why I’m dedicating time to learning the fundamentals of neural networks by building them from scratch—without relying on frameworks that simplify the process.

In this GitHub repository, I’m showcasing my journey as I learn and implement neural networks step-by-step. My goal is to not only grasp the mathematical and computational concepts behind these powerful models but also to build a solid foundation that will make me a better problem solver and engineer in the AI/ML field.

I am following the playlist '[Building Neural Networks from Scratch](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPTV0NXA_ZSj6tNyn_UadmUeU3Q3oR-hu&si=lzsXajoJO1lgPNCJ)' by [Dr. Raj Abhijit Dandekar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raj-abhijit-dandekar-67a33118a/) on [Vizuara](https://www.youtube.com/@vizuara) youtube channel.

## What You’ll Find Here
- **Handcrafted Neural Networks:** A collection of Python implementations of neural networks, built from the ground up.
- **Step-by-Step Progress:** Code is organized in a way that reflects my learning path—from simple single-layer perceptrons to more complex architectures.
- **Explanations and Insights:** Each implementation is accompanied by detailed comments and explanations to demonstrate the thought process behind the code.
- **Future Plans:** As I progress, I’ll tackle more advanced architectures like convolutional and recurrent neural networks, optimizing them for real-world tasks.

## Why This Matters
Learning to build neural networks from scratch empowers me to:

Understand the intricate details of forward and backward propagation.
Debug and optimize models with greater confidence.
Bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical applications.
This repository isn’t just a project—it’s a reflection of my journey in mastering the core concepts of deep learning. By sharing my progress, I aim to contribute to the learning community and inspire others to dive deeper into understanding the inner workings of neural networks.

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, and join me in this exciting journey!
